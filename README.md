# OCTA-AV
**OCTA-AV** is an open-source toolbox that enables **automated artery–vein (AV) segmentation** and **quantitative feature analysis** on **optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA)** images for studying vascular changes in retinal diseases.

# Features
- **Quantitative OCTA metrics** (BVD, VSD, BVC, BVT, VPI, VCI, FAZ, PID, VAF, NBFI, FAZ-A, FAZ-P, FAZ-CI).
- **Deep learning–based AV segmentation** with separate artery- and vein-specific metrics.
- **ETDRS grid-based regional analysis** for standardized retinal assessment.

# Installation
The installer is a **standalone installer (.exe)** that includes all necessary dependencies.
- **Download the Full Installer** from the [Link](https://uofi.box.com/s/4khlb5nzhs1jh6o3ulf22k3iajwwspm5).
